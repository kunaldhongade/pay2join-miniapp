# 🤔 Interesting , tell me more !

Alright , we’re excited too :)

---

## **What This Program Is**

The TON Dev Experience Lab is a short , 3 week initiative where a small group of developers test TON’s developer ecosystem and tell us how to make it better .

❌ It’s not a course

❌ ~~Hackathon~~ → ✅ Hands on review sprint
✅ Designed to improve TON’s docs , tools and onboarding

---

## 🧐 **What Participants Actually Do**

Across 3 weeks , developers will :

- Review TON’s documentation and tell us what works and what doesn’t
- Compare TON docs to other stack (like React) and ecosystems docs like Solana , Polygon and Ethereum
- Try dApp & smart contract toolkit
- Report bugs , missing features and UX issues in tooling and docs
- Build a small prototype to validate how smooth or painful the documentation is

_This helps us understand real friction points instead of theoretical guesses_

---

## ❓ **Why We’re Doing This**

:image: **TON** is growing fast and we need a better developer experience to match that scale . - Real , unbiased developer feedback -

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 We wish to include a diverse set of developers who’s collective work would ensure better onboarding for every future developer

🤝🏻 Each group gives us a different angle on what’s confusing , what’s missing and what needs improvement

---

## We wish to understand

What makes onboarding slow

- What breaks the flow for first time users
- What’s unclear in docs
- What tools need fixes or redesign
- Where TON is weaker or stronger than other chains

_The goal is simple: make TON easier , clearer and more developer friendly_

---

## 🗒️ **How It Works**

- We select 20 developers based on their skills and knowledge.
- Participants complete weekly tasks and share structured feedback
- Top contributors whose work has meaningful impact receive rewards
- Everyone gets a certificate and exposure
- We summarize all findings in a final documentation improvement report

_It’s focused feedback with real impact ._

---

## 🔍 **Who Should Join**

Anyone with software development experience who wants :

- Early access to TON’s dev ecosystem
- Direct influence on TON’s docs and tools
- A spotlight from the official TON community
- A chance to build a simple prototype and get feedback

## 🎉 **It’s a WIN-WIN for everyone !**

👥 **Participants** get

• Hands on experience with TON

• Direct interaction with TON DevRel

• Visibility and credential boost

• Rewards for meaningful contributions

:image: **TON** gets

## Week 2: Implementation tasks by persona

Here are suggested tasks to cover during the second week when going through documentation to review by implementation

**Novice**

- Set up a TON wallet and send your first on‑chain transfer.
- Explore TON explorers and read a simple transaction trace.
- Deploy a basic Jetton using a no‑code or low‑code tool.
- Interact with a Telegram Mini App that uses TON Connect.
- Run a simple get method on a contract using a public API.

**Nomad**

- Write and deploy your first smart contract with Tact or FunC.
- Build a simple TMA that connects a TON wallet via TON Connect.
- Mint a Jetton with custom metadata and verify it on chain.
- Test and debug your contract using local TVM tools.
- Implement gas estimation and understand execution phases from traces.

**TON Pro**

- Implement a multi‑contract architecture with sharding‑aware message flows.
- Use advanced TVM features like continuations and builder logic.
- Write custom on‑chain libraries for reusable logic.
- Build a production‑grade staking or vesting contract with an upgrade path.
- Integrate Merkle proofs and system contracts for trustless verification.

## Week 2 Mini Project (Recommended): Pay‑to‑Join Group / Content (Paywall)

This is a simple “real app” that tests TON’s docs + tooling end-to-end: wallet connection → payment → on-chain verification → unlock content.

### ✅ What you are building

- A **Paywall smart contract** on TON.
- Users send a fixed amount of TON to the contract to buy access.
- Contract records access (example: **valid until timestamp**).
- Frontend (web or Telegram Mini App) checks access via a **get method** and unlocks content.

### 🔑 Important concept: “content is not stored on-chain”

TON smart contracts are great for **payments + access state**, not for serving large content.

- **On-chain**: price, owner, payments, and access list / expiry.
- **Off-chain**: the actual “group link / premium page / file”, gated by checking `hasAccess()`.

### 🧱 Minimal contract requirements (spec)

**Storage**
- `owner: Address`
- `price: Coins` (example: 0.5 TON)
- `accessDurationSec: Int` (example: 30 days)
- `accessUntil: map<Address, Int>` (unix time until access is valid)

**Messages (internal)**
1) **BuyAccess**
- Anyone can call it by sending `value >= price`.
- Contract sets `accessUntil[sender] = max(oldAccessUntil, now) + accessDurationSec`
- Contract keeps funds (owner withdraws later).

2) **Withdraw**
- Only `owner` can withdraw contract balance (optionally keep a minimum for storage rent).

3) (Optional) **Admin updates**
- `SetPrice(newPrice)`
- `SetAccessDuration(newDuration)`

**Get methods (read-only)**
- `getPrice()` → current price
- `getOwner()` → owner address
- `getAccessUntil(user)` → timestamp
- `hasAccess(user, now)` → bool (or compute in frontend)

### 🔁 UX flow (what users do)

1) User opens your app page / Telegram Mini App.
2) User connects wallet via **TON Connect**.
3) App shows “Pay X TON to unlock”.
4) User clicks Pay → wallet sends transaction to paywall contract.
5) App waits for confirmation (or polls) then calls `getAccessUntil(user)` and unlocks content.

### 🛠️ Implementation steps with `create-ton`

**1) Scaffold the project**
- Run: `npm create ton@latest`
- **Project name**: `pay2join` (or any)
- **Contract name**: must be **PascalCase and start with a capital letter**
  - ✅ `Pay2Join`
  - ✅ `MyTonApp`
  - ❌ `myTonApp` (this is why you saw: “Cannot create a contract with the name 'myTonApp'”)
- **Template**: pick **“An empty contract (Tact)”** for a clean start.

**2) Implement Paywall logic**
- Add `price`, `accessDurationSec`, mapping `accessUntil[address]`
- Implement buy + withdraw handlers
- Add get methods (price + access checks)

**3) Add a minimal frontend**
Frontend only needs:
- connect wallet (TON Connect)
- “Pay” button
- “Check access” (calls get method)
- conditional UI: locked vs unlocked

**4) Test locally**
Test cases to run:
- user pays exactly price → access granted
- user pays less than price → rejected (document behavior)
- same user pays twice → expiry extends
- non-owner withdraw → rejected
- owner withdraw → success

**5) Deploy to testnet + verify end-to-end**
- contract deployed
- app connects wallet
- payment works
- access check works from get method
- unlock UI shows correctly

### 📚 Docs to review while doing this (collect links + screenshots)

- TON Connect overview: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/overview
- Messages & transactions: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/messages-and-transactions
- Execution phases (debugging): https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/execution-phases
- Traces: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/traces
- Estimate gas usage: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/estimate-gas-usage-in-ton-contracts
- Tact language: https://tact-lang.org/

### 🧪 “Week 2” feedback prompts (write these as you build)

**UX**
- Was it obvious how to choose between FunC/Tact/Tolk templates?
- Was `create-ton` error messaging clear (PascalCase requirement)?
- Was local testing and deployment smooth?

**Clarity**
- Did docs show a full “payment → on-chain state → UI unlock” example?
- Were there concrete TON Connect examples for a **paywall** (not just “connect wallet”)?

**Factual accuracy**
- Any commands that didn’t work as shown?
- Any SDK versions / links outdated?

### 🧩 Suggested TON docs improvements (based on this project)

If you hit friction, these are high-impact doc additions:
- A **“Paywall / Pay-to-Join” tutorial** (contract + TON Connect UI + verification loop).
- A `create-ton` page that clearly states **contract naming rules** (PascalCase, start uppercase) with examples.
- A short guide: **“How to unlock off-chain content using a get method”** (best practices + security notes).
